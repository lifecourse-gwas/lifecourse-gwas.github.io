These projects can be, for example, new analytical approaches on the data already being generated, or the proposal of additional phenotypic areas for analysis.\nNew or existing members wishing to propose a new project should do so by completing the project proposal form (TBC) and submitting the proposal to the core research group. Proposals will undergo a basic evaluation by the executive committee and core research group for practical feasibility and scientific relevance. All accepted project proposals will be published here for transparency. For all approved project proposals, the project lead will be responsible for establishing a dedicated working group and for executing the study, with subsequent papers appropriately attributing the Lifecourse GWAS consortium."

    "text": "The Lifecourse GWAS consortium was established by researchers at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (University of Bristol) to gain a better understanding of how exposures experienced at different stages in the lifecourse may influence later life health outcomes.\n\nAims and Objectives\nUnderstanding how the influence of risk factors on disease change over the lifecourse can be improved in a Mendelian randomization framework. However age-stratified genetic effects are required for such analyses. As a result, we are seeking to establish a consortium dedicated to generating and integrating data using an age-stratified GWAS approach.\nTo explore how selected exposures at different stages in the lifecourse modify risk, we will:\n\nGenerate GWAS summary data for specified ages and age-ranges across the lifecourse for 24 phenotypes.\nCombine results by meta-analysing at the age X phenotype level across studies.\nModel changes in genetic effects over time at the post-meta-analysis stage.\nEvaluate the influence of biasing mechanisms on GxAge interaction estimates.\nConduct post GxAge analyses, for e.g. time-varying MR, and provide a user-friendly tool for researchers interested in using the data generated.\n\n\n\nCurrent status\nWe are currently recruiting studies to join the Consortium.

The use of standardised procedures across all samples is critical in order to increase the effectiveness of the subsequent meta-analyses that will be run internally upon receipt of these GWAS.\n\n\nAcute, chronic, and recurring adverse health conditions that emerge in later life are often shaped by processes experienced throughout life. Gaining a better understanding of how exposures at different stages in the lifecourse influence health outcomes is key to elucidating the potential benefits of specific disease prevention and treatment strategies.\nMendelian randomisation (MR) is a technique that exploits the random assortment of genetic variants inherited from parents to offspring, independent of other traits. This reduces susceptibility to confounding factors, including confounding by undiagnosed existing disease (reverse causation). MR is increasingly being used to estimate causal effects of modifiable risk factors across the lifecourse on later life outcomes. To robustly run MR, valid instrumental variables must be employed which require large-scale datasets comprising phenotype and genotype data. Consequently, analyses are currently confined to the examination of a narrow selection of phenotypes at a few specific time periods due to data restrictions regarding the measurement of multiple phenotypes at specific time periods in most cohort studies.\n\n\n\nThis consortium sets out to expand potential in this area, by aggregating these data from a wide range of cohorts. This will enable us to develop a more comprehensive set of instruments for future MR analyses to be able to estimate the effects of a range of phenotypes at multiple time periods across the lifecourse on later life outcomes.\nIn order to explore how selected phenotypes at different stages in the lifecourse modify risk, we seek to combine the results of multiple genome-wide association studies of these phenotypes in meta-analyses. This will increase the probability of detection of genetic variants associated with individual differences to generate valid instrumental variables for use in MR analyses.\n\n\n\nPhenotypes\n\n\n\n\nBody mass index\n\n\nHeight\n\n\nWaist circumference\n\n\nWaist to hip ratio\n\n\nHeel bone mineral density\n\n\nForced expiratory volume in 1 second\n\n\nFEV1/FVC ratio\n\n\nSystolic blood pressure\n\n\nLDL cholesterol\n\n\nHDL cholesterol\n\n\nTriglycerides\n\n\nC-reactive protein\n\n\nInterleukin 6\n\n\nLeptin\n\n\nGlycated haemoglobin\n\n\nInsulin\n\n\nAdiponectin\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\nVitamin D\n\n\nEstradiol\n\n\nTestosterone\n\n\nSex hormone binding globulin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA detailed description of the analysis plan is available here"

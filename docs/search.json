The use of standardised procedures across all samples is critical in order to increase the effectiveness of the subsequent meta-analyses that will be run internally upon receipt of these GWAS."

These projects can be, for example, new analytical approaches on the data already being generated, or the proposal of additional phenotypic areas for analysis.\nNew or existing members wishing to propose a new project should do so by completing the project proposal form (TBC) and submitting the proposal to the core research group. Proposals will undergo a basic evaluation by the executive committee and core research group for practical feasibility and scientific relevance. All accepted project proposals will be published here for transparency. For all approved project proposals, the project lead will be responsible for establishing a dedicated working group and for executing the study, with subsequent papers appropriately attributing the Lifecourse GWAS consortium."

    "text": "The Lifecourse GWAS consortium was established by researchers at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (University of Bristol) to gain a better understanding of how exposures experienced at different stages in the lifecourse may influence later life health outcomes.\n\nAims and Objectives\nUnderstanding how the influence of risk factors on disease change over the lifecourse can be improved in a Mendelian randomization framework. However age-stratified genetic effects are required for such analyses. As a result, we are seeking to establish a consortium dedicated to generating and integrating data using an age-stratified GWAS approach.\nTo explore how selected exposures at different stages in the lifecourse modify risk, we will:\n\nGenerate GWAS summary data for specified ages and age-ranges across the lifecourse for 24 phenotypes.\nCombine results by meta-analysing at the age X phenotype level across studies.\nModel changes in genetic effects over time at the post-meta-analysis stage.\nEvaluate the influence of biasing mechanisms on GxAge interaction estimates.\nConduct post GxAge analyses, for e.g. time-varying MR, and provide a user-friendly tool for researchers interested in using the data generated.\n\n\n\nCurrent status\nWe are currently recruiting studies to join the Consortium. Please contact us and complete this form if you are interested in being involved.\n\n\nExecutive committee and Core group\nThe executive committee has been set-up to provide oversight and review the development of the Lifecourse GWAS consortium. The finalised list of executive committee members is TBC.\nThe core research group comprises:\nDr. Grace Power, Prof. Gibran Hemani, Dr. Eleanor Sanderson, Dr. Genevieve Leyden and Dr. David Carslake\n\n\nContact information\nTo get in touch please email lifecourse-gwas-group@bristol.ac.uk"
